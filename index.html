                🚫 Officially Not Trump 🚫<br>
                We're all about the art of the deal—dealing in memes, that is. No fake news here, just real laughs. No tariffs on humor, no dumps on your timeline, and definitely no scams. Just pure, unadulterated vibes. We're here to meme, not to scheme. 😎

            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>
                We're aiming for a 1:1 ratio of $TRUMP to $PMURT because, let's face it, balance is key. We're flipping the script, one meme at a time, and we're not afraid to negotiate. Our trade policy? Free memes for all. 📈

            <h2>Roadmap (Subject to Meme Magic)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Q4 2023: Major exchange listing. We're making deals to get listed on the big platforms. No quid pro quo, just good old-fashioned meme power. 🌕</li>
                <li>Q1 2024: PMURT merch drop. Think 'Make Memes Great Again' hats and 'Covfefe' mugs. Because who doesn’t love a good meme reference? 🕊️</li>
                <li>Q2 2024: Partner with meme lords and viral communities. We're building a coalition of the willing—willing to laugh, that is. 🤝</li>
                <li>Q3 2024: Expand into NFTs. Exclusive PMURT art for the degens. Each NFT comes with a digital 'covfefe'—a typo that could be worth millions. 🎨</li>
            </ul>
